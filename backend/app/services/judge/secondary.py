"""Secondary LLM judge — the pluggable second opinion in the ensemble.

This is the "plug in another LLM" slot. It talks to any OpenAI-compatible
endpoint (OpenAI, another vLLM, a gateway, ...) configured via
`JUDGE_SECONDARY_*` settings, and grades on the same 1..5 absolute scale so its
vote can be averaged with the primary judge to reduce single-judge subjectivity.

Falls back to a deterministic mock when `mock_judge` is on or no API key is set.
